Script to create a GEE credential file from a environment variable.

The script should be run in CD/CI environment as Github actions. It copy the credentials saved by maintainers in the "EARTHENGINE_TOKEN" environment variable and copy them to the appropriate file so that the test can be run. Note that the credentials have expiration dates so it will need to be changed on regular basis. Not intended for local dev as the user should be authenticated.
