Easy access to administrative boundary defined by GADM from Python scripts.

This lib provides access to GADM datasets from a Python script without downloading the file from their server. We provide access to The current version (4.1.) which delimits 400,276 administrative areas.

The data are freely available for academic use and other non-commercial use. Redistribution, or commercial use is not allowed without prior permission. See the license of the GADM project for more details.

    Return a Geopandas GeoDataFrame representing an administrative region. The region can be requested either by its "name" or its "admin", the lib will identify the area level on the fly.
